# Graphs

A graph is a data structure consisting of a set of nodes connected with a set of edges, representing relations between different elements in a set of components. <br>
Grpaphs are used to solve many real life problems, graphs are used to represent networks, like social media networks, city roads network, telephone network or circuit networks, etc. Each node of the graph contains information about one single element, and are connected to each other with an edge, which can be either directed or not directed and has a weight, representing the cost of the connection. <br>

## Spanning tree

A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph containing all the nodes of the graph with the minium possible number of edges, in other words, is a graph where all nodes are connected with the fewest connections possible. The prim algorithm is capable of getting the spanning tree. <br>
We can use the spanning tree when we want to visit all the neighbours of a city using the shortest path, spanning tree is a solution in this type of problems. <br>

## Shortest path 

What if we want to find the shortest path from one point to another? Dijkstra algorithm is here to solve the problem! Dijkstra is an algorithm that finds the optimum path from a startpoint to an endpoint. <br>
Path finding algorithms are used in map services, an essential tool for all of us. <br>

## Euler cycle 

Euler cycle goes throught every connection one single time and ends in the startpoint. The Fleury algorithm is capable to solve this problem. <br>

## Flow network 

A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and receives a flow. <br>
A flow network is like a network of pipelines, where water goes throught pipelinees, and the flow can not exceed the capacity. <br>
Finding the maxium flow network can solve lot of optimization problems, for example: An oil company wants to send extracted oil to a destination in other city through pipelines and the company has a huge network of pipelines, the maxium flow network will optimize the use of the pipelines to send the biggest ammount of oil possible to the destination, using the maxium capability of each pipelines. <br>
